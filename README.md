# ESPanel

I recently learned how to make spring boot applications in combination with angular.  
So this was the perfect opportunity for me to start a new project with those frameworks.

I always wanted to create a control panel for a smarthome approach using the ESP8266 microcontroler,  
so I did exactly that.

This repo includes the front- and backend part of the application  
I haven't made a repo with the microcontroler code, because I'm not fully satisfied with the program yet.  
Maybe I'll put it up here in the future :).

The application is not perfect yet, but it fills my needs.  
Please feel free to branch and adapt it for your needs ^^.
